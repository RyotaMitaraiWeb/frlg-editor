# Write-ups Editor for FRLG
An editor for write-ups for the FRLG in-game tier list. [Link to tool](https://ryotamitaraiweb.github.io/frlg-editor/)

## How to use
You have six fields. The first one is for the Pokemon name. The next ones are for each section: Availability, Typing, Stats, Movepool, Major Battles, and Additional Comments. The editor will update the preview and BBCode every time you make a change to any of the fields.

The editor will automatically add a full stop at the end of each section, provided that you haven't added one yourself. The editor will also escape all em dashes for GP purposes.

It is recommended to avoid using this application with mobile data due to the possibility of it eating up your data.
